-  Hi, Iâ€™m Ardeshir 
-  Extremely interested in learning
-  currently bulding a full stack platform for a flower shop named 'Fleur Gratuite' with Next.js and TypeScript, using MongoDB to build an api full of different features, using next-auth to make authentication more accessible and easy, after making the server functional and useable I'll dive into fornt-end(Or I'll try to write some test for the server), in fornt-end I'll use redux for state management, styled components to handle styling more easily and more orginized, framer-motion to make the user experience more fluid and enjoyable, three.js to make some flowers and some exceptional user interface.
